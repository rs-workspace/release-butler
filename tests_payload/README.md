# GitHub Webhook Example Payloads

This directory is used to keep example payloads of GitHub webhook events. These payloads may not hold correct information as they are created by AI and also copied from random places on the Internet. These are just for serialization purposes.

For more information, see the [`tests`](../tests/) directory.
